Here are the steps to install Jenkins on an AWS Linux instance:

1. Log in to your AWS Linux instance using SSH.

2. Update the instance's package index by running the following command:
```
sudo yum update -y
```

3. Install Java on the instance by running the following command:
```
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
```

4. Import the Jenkins repository key using the following command:
```
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
```

5. Add the Jenkins repository to your instance's repository list using the following command:
```
 sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
```

6. Install Jenkins by running the following command:
```
sudo yum install jenkins -y
```

7. Start the Jenkins service using the following command:
```
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

8. Enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot using the following command:
```
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

9. Open the Jenkins web interface by navigating to `http://<your-instance-public-ip>:8080` in your web browser. You may need to configure your security group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080.

10. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the Jenkins setup wizard.

That's it! You should now have a fully functional Jenkins installation running on your AWS Linux instance.
